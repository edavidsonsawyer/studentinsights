        The Notes tab is the place to keep notes about a student, whether it’s SST, MTSS,         a parent conversation, or some informal strategies that a teacher/team is using to help a student.         More formal strategies (e.g. the student meets with a tutor or counselor every week) should be recorded in Services.

        <b>
          {'Who can enter a note? '}
        </b>
        Anyone who works with or involved with the student,         including classroom/ELL/SPED teachers, principals/assistant principals, counselors, and attendance officers.

        The true test is to think about whether the information will help your         team down the road in supporting this student, either in the coming weeks, or a few years from now. Examples include:

          {`"Oscar just showed a 20 point increase in ORF. It seems like the take home readings are working (parents are very supportive) and we will continue it."`}

        <li>
          {`"This is a follow-up MTSS meeting for Julie. Over the last 4 weeks, she is not showing many gains despite the volunteer tutor and the change in seating…."`}

        <li>
          {`"Alex just got an M on the latest F&P. Will try having him go next door to join the other 4th grade group during guided reading."`}

        <li>
          {`"Medicine change for Uri on 4/10. So far slight increase in focus."`}

        <li>
          {`"Mediation occurred between Oscar and Uri and went well. Both have agreed to keep distance for 2 weeks."`}

          {`"Parent called to report that Jill won art award and will be going to nationals. She suggested this might be an outlet if she shows frustration in schoolwork."`}
