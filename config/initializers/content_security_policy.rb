# TODO(kr) in the longer term, we should probably migrate to this and remove
# secure_headers.  Unfortunately it sounds like this is only CSP and so won't
# replace other protections secure_headers providers (eg, HTTP headers).
# It also sounds enabling just the CSP here may conflict with the secure_headers
# config.  Since this change would only be a maintenance improvement, not a
# security improvement, punting it for now.

# Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.

# Define an application-wide content security policy

#   policy.object_src  :none

#   policy.style_src   :self, :https

#   # Specify URI for violation reports
