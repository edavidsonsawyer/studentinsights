# Add new inflection rules using the following format. Inflections
# are locale specific, and you may define rules for as many different
# locales as you wish. All of these examples are active by default:
ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
  # inflect.plural /^(ox)$/i, '\1en'
  # inflect.singular /^(ox)en/i, '\1'
  # inflect.irregular 'person', 'people'
  # inflect.uncountable %w( fish sheep )

  # These were added because in Rails 6, zeitwerk uses this
  # as part of how it loads classes (eg, LDAPAuthenticator, MockLDAP).
  inflect.acronym 'LDAP'
  inflect.acronym 'PowerBI'
end

# These inflection rules are supported but not enabled by default:
# ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
#   inflect.acronym 'RESTful'
# end
