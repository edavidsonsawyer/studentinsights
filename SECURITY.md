# Security Policy
The protection of individual sensitive and personally identifiable information is the highest priority for Student Insights. As threats to school data systems evolve, we continue to add defenses and additional security measures to ensure student information is private and secure. Even if it means developing fewer features, we promise to allocate time and energy to this important work. Our project priorities and changelog are public, and if we are not living up to this promise, please contact us at hello@studentinsights.org.
